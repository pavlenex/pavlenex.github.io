Design a single page personal website for a Bitcoin Product Manager that looks like a modern project management dashboard. Desktop view, 1440 px wide, clean minimal style, lots of white space, soft shadows, rounded corners.
Layout:
Left sidebar that feels like a project management app. At the top show a small logo, then a large button labeled "Start a new project". Below that show social icons (GitHub, X, Email) and a compact user profile with a circular photo, name "Pat D", and title "Bitcoin Product Manager". Under the profile add slim navigation links like Overview, Projects, Writing, Contact.
Main content on the right should look like a PM dashboard.
Hero section at top of main area:
Big title "Bitcoin Product Manager".
Short subtitle about accelerating Bitcoin adoption with open source payment solutions and mining infrastructure.
On the right, a rounded card with a larger portrait photo of Pat on a mountain, with a subtle glow behind the card.
Below the hero, show a Kanban board styled like a portfolio board:
Three columns with headings: "Current", "In Progress", "Completed". Each heading has a small colored dot indicator.
Each column contains project cards with title, one line description, and colored pill tags.
Current: Spiral (tags: Grantee, Bitcoin).
In Progress: BTCPay Server (tags: Product Strategy, Bitcoin, Payments) and Stratum V2 (tags: Bitcoin, Mining, Protocol).
Completed: Bitcoin Design (tags: Design, Open Source), Bitcoin Smiles (tags: Non profit, El Salvador), BitcoinShirt.co (tags: E commerce, Bitcoin), Hub21 (tags: Research, Community).
Each card is white with soft shadow, subtle border, rounded corners. Tags are small colored pills like in modern SaaS dashboards.
Overall visual style:
Light background with a very subtle gradient.
Accent colors in soft purple and green for status dots and tag pills.
Clean sans serif typography. Use hierarchy in type sizes for headings, columns, and card content.
Everything should feel like a polished PM tool that doubles as a personal portfolio, not like a typical blog.
